INSTALLATION
============
There are compatiblity issues with some Virtualbox and Vagrant versions, including what are at times the latest versions of both. This is because vagrant needs to be changed every time an incompatible feature is added to Virtualbox.

First, you need to install compatible versions of Virtualbox and Vagrant. I used the following and suggest you use the same:
Vagrant: 1.5.2 (You could probably use a later version in the future if it becomes available)
VirtualBox: 4.3.6 (Be careful using a higher version, it will probably not work)
